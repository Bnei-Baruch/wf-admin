We've built semantic-ui css with a scoping class
so that ltr and rtl could co-exist.

Follow the normal procedure to obtain semantic-ui docs
as found at https://semantic-ui.com/introduction/getting-started.html

Better do it in a clean folder.
The version we used was 2.2.14
So npm install semantic-ui@2.2.14 --save

choose all components, default directories and compile *both* ltr and rtl.

next in /src create 2 less files

$ cat scoped_semantic_*.less

.scoped-semantic-ltr {
  @import (less) "dist/semantic.css";
}

.scoped-semantic-rtl {
  @import (less) "dist/semantic.rtl.css";
}

install less.js with
sudo npm install -g less

then compile the 2 files:
$ lessc scoped_semantic_ltr.less scoped_semantic_ltr.css
$ lessc scoped_semantic_rtl.less scoped_semantic_rtl.css

and copy them to src/stylesheets along with the themes folder
from the semantic dist folder generated during your gulp build

next extract reset section (~ first 900 rows) in scoped_semantic_ltr.css
to a dedicated file sematic-reset.css
